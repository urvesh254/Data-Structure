# Data-Structure
Implement Data structure using java in CLI mode. Data structures Like Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Binary Search Tree etc.

Also implement the Binary search visulization using java swing package. In which we see how node is add in BST and how node is delete in BST. 

For deletion in BST there two methods if node have two children. We can replace deleted node by left subtree maximum node. or replace by right subtree minimum node.
